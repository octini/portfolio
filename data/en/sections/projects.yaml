  summary: A home media server deployed to a low-energy box running TrueNAS SCALE, accessible via custom domain routed through Cloudflare Tunnels. The server's frontend employs a combination of Jellyfin, Audiobookshelf, and Calibre Web Server. New media is automatically added courtesy of a collection of applications configured to procure specific public domain content. Specific content not already acquired through filtering can be requested via a custom Discord bot connected to the server via webhooks. The server runs on an isolated VLAN and has most applications deployed as self-hosted solutions as custom Docker containers.
